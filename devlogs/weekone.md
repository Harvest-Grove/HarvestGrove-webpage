Hey farmers! 👋
We’re excited to kick off our weekly development updates so you can follow along with what’s happening behind the scenes in Harvest Grove!

## Team Growth
First things first — a warm welcome to all the new faces joining the team!;
We’ve now grown to 8 members:

- 3 programmers
- 2 artists
- 2 composers
- 1 writer 

It’s been amazing seeing the project come to life thanks to everyone’s hard work.
We’re still on the lookout for additional artists, so if you—or someone you know—want to help shape the world of Harvest Grove, let us know!

## Bugs (fun ones)
As always, development wouldn’t be complete without a few “interesting” bugs along the way, right?
Check out the videos below for some of our recent favorites — don’t worry tho, they’ve all been fixed!
